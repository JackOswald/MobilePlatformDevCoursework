# Traffic Scotland Mobile Application

An application created in Android Studio using Java. This application parses data from https://trafficscotland.org and displays the current incidents, roadworks and planned roadworks. This application was for my Mobile Platform Development coursework.

# What I Learned
* Read an RSS feed
* Parse data from XML file 
* Develop a UI with XML files using buttons, views and text
* Display data in a scrollable list view in both landscape and portrait mode
* Add an image to each view based on the severity of the incident
* Search specific date on calendar or specific road on search bar
